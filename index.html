            We put a major focus on the UI/UX that we design for our customers. 
            What is UI/UX you ask? It is short for User Interface and User Experience.
            We make sure that you don't just have the most beautiful website you can get, 
            but we also put major focus on the experience of the user to minimize confusion 
            and reduce the frustration of not knowing how to find the information that they need.
            If your clients have a pleseant experience navigating your site then they are more than 
            likely to feel good about working with you.

            We don't want you to just take our word for it. Here is a couple of links that really show the importance 
            of having a well thoughtout and beautiful website for your clients and for your business. <br><br>

        <p class="body-p">
            One major thing that you as a business owner and us as a development team must focus heavily on is Responsive Web Design,
            also known as mobile friendly design. According to TechCrunch, by the year 2020, there will be a staggering
            <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/6-1b-smartphone-users-globally-by-2020-overtaking-basic-fixed-phone-subscriptions/">
                6.1 billion Smartphone users</a>. 
            Which makes it pretty obvious that a very large amount of your web traffic 
            would come from someone on a Mobile phone, but according to 
            <a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/mobile-percentage-of-traffic/">Hosting Tribunal</a>
            the amount of traffic that is from a mobile device is 90%!!
            With numbers like that it's extrodinarily important to make sure your website doesn't just look good on a desktop, but 
            a mobile phone as well. 
        </p>

        <p class="body-p">
            Mobile Responsive design is extremely important, but that's not all when it comes to the layout of your website.
            Clients also want to know about what your company does and what product you are selling. 
            <a href="https://komarketing.com/files/b2b-web-usability-report-2015.pdf">Studies show</a> 
            that 86% of visitors who land on a conpany's webside homepage say they want to see information about the company's 
            products and services. Ease of navigation is one thing but properly presenting what it is that you do is the 
            most important thing.
        </p>

        <a id="user-experiences" class="hidden-left graphic" href="https://komarketing.com/files/b2b-web-usability-report-2015.pdf">
            <img src="examples/information-layout.png" alt="user experiences">
        </a>

        <p class="body-p">
            A poor UI/UX design can leave potential clients questioning the quality of your business or, 
            even worse, not knowing what it is that you are selling or what kind of law you specialize in. 
            The last thing you want is for a client to struggle when, lets face it, they're most likely
            going through a difficult time as it is. Let your clients know you take pride in every aspect 
            of your professional life by starting with the right foot forward.
